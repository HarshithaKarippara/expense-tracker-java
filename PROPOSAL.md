For my final project, I will build a Personal Finance Expense Tracker, a console-based Java application designed to help users better understand and optimize their daily financial decisions. The program will allow users to record expenses, categorize their spending (such as food, transportation, subscriptions, or shopping), and view detailed summaries that highlight where their money is going each week or month. In addition to basic tracking, I will incorporate a new feature called the Smart Cashback Advisor, which analyzes the item a user wants to purchase and recommends which of their stored credit cards will give them the highest cashback or rewards based on category (for example, telling a user that their Discover card offers 5% back on groceries this quarter). The project will use multiple classes including a base Transaction class with subclasses like RecurringExpense and OneTimeExpense, a Category class, a BudgetManager class to manage collections of transactions, and a CreditCard class to store reward structures. I will also implement a custom interface (such as Summarizable) that allows certain objects to generate formatted reports. The application will use an ArrayList to store expenses, iterate through them using loops, apply conditionals to categorize spending and determine cashback recommendations, and save/load all transaction data from a text file to ensure persistence between sessions. Finally, I will include a small recursive method for example, calculating the total projected cost of a recurring expense across several months. This project aims to be practical, user-friendly, and genuinely helpful as a financial tool while meeting all requirements for object-oriented design, recursion, interfaces, file I/O, and good software organization.
