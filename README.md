# Personal Finance Expense Tracker

## Project Overview
The Personal Finance Expense Tracker is a Java application designed to help users record, organize, and analyze their personal spending in a simple and intuitive way. The program allows users to add both one-time and recurring expenses, categorize transactions, view summaries, and project future costs. To make the application more professional and user-friendly, the interface is implemented using Java Swing’s `JOptionPane` dialogs rather than relying solely on console input.

A key focus of this project is demonstrating core object-oriented programming concepts, including inheritance, interfaces, encapsulation, and polymorphism. The application also incorporates file input/output to persist data across sessions and uses recursion to calculate the projected cost of recurring expenses over time. Development was tracked using GitHub with multiple commits to show iterative progress.
